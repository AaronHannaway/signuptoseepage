# Signup to see page
This is a simple HTML and CSS that you will need to edit a bit to set up, but you can use this to make pages not be able to be seen without having an account on the website. It has a very stunning UI Design.

## Support

If you need support please make an issue and I will try to get back to you. If you are experienced with HTML and CSS then maybe you can help people if you wish.

## Usage
You can use this to make pages restricted, or make sure people have an account to view the page. You will need to set up this with your DataStorage to access AccountManagement
